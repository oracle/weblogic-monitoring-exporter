Monitoring with Prometheus and Kibana using the WebLogic Monitoring Exporter
=====

Here are some examples of deployments to start Prometheus and Kibana in the Kubernetes cluster, and an example of the RBAC policy to set up all the required permissions to access pods.

All the examples are configured to be deployed in the `monitoring` namespace. The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator is deployed in the `weblogic-operator` namespace and the WebLogic domain runs in the `weblogic-domain` namespace.

You can customize the examples to reflect a specific configuration.

For more details on how to set up and run Prometheus and Kibana with the WebLogic Monitoring Exporter, see the blog post, [Using Prometheus and Grafana to Monitor WebLogic Server on Kubernetes](https://blogs.oracle.com/weblogicserver/use-prometheus-and-grafana-to-monitor-weblogic-server-on-kubernetes).
