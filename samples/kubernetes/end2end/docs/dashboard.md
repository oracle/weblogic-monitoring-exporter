## What's in the Weblogic Dashboard
### Overview
The WebLogic Dashboard helps you know what's going on inside WebLogic servers, how much traffic they're getting, how they're performing, any errors etc.

On top of the Weblogic dashboard, there are some filters which allows you to filter out metrics of different domain, different cluster and different server(s). Another filter is `Top N` whose candidates values are 3, 5, 7 and 10. The value will be applied to some panels to only show the top N elements to avoid too many elements displayed.  

The WebLogic dashboard has four rows: `Servers`, `Web Applications`, `Data Sources` and `JMS Services`, each row can be folded and unfolded separately.
